# What are the considerations for a style guide?

**1. Audience**

The answers to the following questions will impact the style guidelines.

- Who is the documentation being written for? 
  - Is the audience global? Will the documentation have to be translated? 
  - Should the "level" of a document be pitched at beginners or experts?
- The value of a document should be considered - what does it help the user to achieve? 
  - What is useful for the user to know?
  
  
**2. Structure**

There should be guidelines on the structure of documents.

- Guidelines on structuring a book (e.g. front cover, title page, table of contents, list of figures)
- Guidelines on structuring a task topic (e.g. adding prerequisites and step-by-step instructions)
- Guidelines on structuring a concept topic (e.g. using a short introduction, explaining why a new product feature is more appropriate than another)
- Guidelines on structuring a reference topic (e.g. having a consistent structure for interface documentation, including syntax, parameters, return values and examples)
- Guidelines on documentation website structure (e.g. listing articles in a website's index, adding an article's keywords to a glossary) 


**3. Language and grammar**

There should be guidelines for appropriate language and correct grammar. These guidelines should be extended in specific cases (e.g. for an index or glossary section)

- Guidelines to avoid misleading or confusing language (e.g. don't use slang, words like "automagic", phrases like "happy path").
- Guidelines on using neutral language (e.g. avoid using "he" or "she").
- Guidelines on tone (e.g. use authoritative tone instead of unconfident tone)
- Guidelines on active voice versus passive voice
- Guidelines on sentence structure and length 
- Guidelines on abbreviations
- Guidelines on punctuation
- Guidelines on pronouns and verbs
- Guidelines on tense (e.g. use the present tense where possible)
