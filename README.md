# style-guidelines

**1. Audience**

The answers of the following questions will have an impact on the style guidelines.

- Who is the documentation being written for? 
  - Is the audience global? Will the documentation need to be translated? 
  - Should the "level" of a document be pitched at beginners or experts?
- The value of a document should also be considered - what does it help the user to achieve? 
  - What is useful for the user to know?
