# Style guide considerations

## 1. Audience

The answers to the following questions will impact the style guidelines.

- Who is the documentation being written for? 
  - Is the audience global? Will the documentation have to be translated? 
  - Should the "level" of a document be pitched at beginners or experts?
- The value of a document should be considered - what does it help the user to achieve? 
  - What is useful for the user to know?
  
  
## 2. Structure

There should be guidelines on the structure of documents.

- Guidelines on structuring a book (e.g. front cover, title page, table of contents, list of figures).
- Guidelines on structuring a task topic (e.g. adding prerequisites and step-by-step instructions).
- Guidelines on structuring a concept topic (e.g. using a short introduction, explaining why a new product feature is more appropriate than another).
- Guidelines on structuring a reference topic (e.g. having a consistent structure for interface documentation, including syntax, parameters, return values and examples).
- Guidelines on documentation website structure (e.g. listing articles in a website's index, adding an article's keywords to a glossary).


## 3. Language and grammar

There should be guidelines for appropriate language and correct grammar. These guidelines should be extended in specific cases (e.g. for an index or glossary section).

- Guidelines to avoid misleading or confusing language (e.g. don't use slang, words like "automagic", phrases like "happy path").
- Guidelines on using neutral language (e.g. avoid using "he" or "she").
- Guidelines on tone (e.g. use an authoritative tone instead of an unconfident one).
- Guidelines on active voice versus passive voice.
- Guidelines on sentence structure and length.
- Guidelines on abbreviations.
- Guidelines on punctuation.
- Guidelines on pronouns and verbs.
- Guidelines on tense (e.g. use the present tense where possible).


## 4. Formatting

Guidelines to ensure consistent formatting throughout the documentation.

Guidelines on when/where/how to use:
- Bullet points
- Ordered lists
- Headings
- Tables
- Images
- Font style 
- Code blocks and terminal command blocks
- Graphics of user interface components (e.g. dropdowns, icons)


## 5. References

There should be guidelines to ensure consistent referencing of other documents.

- Guidelines on the appropriate reference style that should be used.
- Guidelines on how to link to external content.

## 6. Indexes

There should be guidelines on the organisation and number of levels in an index.

- Guidelines on how to best index task, concept and reference topics on a website.
- Guidelines on how to best index other items (such as a book index).
- Guidelines on the size of index entries (e.g. number of index entries per topic).
- Guidelines on the number of levels in an index.
- Guidelines on the locators in an index.


## 7. Glossary

There should be guidelines on how to create clear and concise glossary entries.

- Guidelines on the structure of an entry (e.g. its definition, plus optional items like a "See also" reference).
- Guidelines on the correct language and grammar use in a glossary entry (e.g. use passive voice).
- Guidelines on the types of glossary terms (e.g. noun, verb).
- Guidelines on what not to include in a glossary (e.g.  product names like MySQL).


## 8. Release Notes

There should be guidelines (and a template?) for creating useful release notes.

- Guidelines on what items to add (e.g. header specifying the release version, new features, fixed bugs).
- Guidelines on format of release notes (e.g. blog-like (with SEO in mind) or a succinct list).
- Guidelines on language and grammar (e.g. how formal should the tone of the release notes be?).
