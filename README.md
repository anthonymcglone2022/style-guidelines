# style-guidelines

**1. Audience**

There should be guidelines around the answers to the following questions. 

- Who is the documentation being written for? 
  - Is the audience global? Will the documentation need to be translated? 
  - Should the "level" of a document be pitched at beginners or experts?
- The value of a document should also be considered. 
  - What does it help the user to achieve? What is useful for the user to know?
