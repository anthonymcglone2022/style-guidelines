**1. Audience**

There should be guidelines for understanding the audience. 

- Who is the documentation being written for?
- What is their level of technical expertise? 
- Is the audience global? Will the documentation need to be translated? 
- Should the "level" of an individual article be pitched at beginners or experts?
