# style-guidelines

**1. Audience**

The answers of the following questions will have an impact on the style guidelines.

- Who is the documentation being written for? 
  - Is the audience global? Will the documentation have to be translated? 
  - Should the "level" of a document be pitched at beginners or experts?
- The value of a document should be considered - what does it help the user to achieve? 
  - What is useful for the user to know?
  
  
**2. Structure**

There should be guidelines on the structure of documents.

- Guidelines on structuring a book (e.g. front cover, title page, table of contents, list of figures)
- Guidelines on structuring a task topic (e.g. adding prerequisites and step-by-step instructions)
- Guidelines on structuring a concept topic (e.g. using a short introduction, explaining why a new product feature is more appropriate than another)
- Guidelines on structuring a reference topic (e.g. have a consistent structure to document interfaces, including syntax, parameters, return value and examples)
- Guidelines on documentation website structure (e.g. listing articles in a website's index, adding an article's keywords to a glossary)
